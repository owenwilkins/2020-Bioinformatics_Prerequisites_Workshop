# Part 2: Basics of Python and Basic Data Types

## Outline 
- [Basic data types](#datatypes)
- [Basic arithmetic](#arithmetic)
- [Comparisons](#comparisons)
- [Basic data structures](#datastructures)
- [Boolean Operations](#operations)
- [Range](#range)
- [String Formatting](#stringformat)
- [Group Exercise](#exercise)

A few notes before we get started:
- Learning all the nuances of python takes a long time! Our goal here is to introduce you to as many concepts as possible
but if you are serious about mastering python you will need to apply yourself beyond this introduction. 
- We bring up a lot of concepts to expose you to them but we encourage you to have a "scientific" mentality and highly
encourage you to continue testing the waters beyond these materials. 


Setup
```
cd /share/workshop/prereq_workshop/$USER/python
python3.8
```

# <a name="datatypes"></a> Basic Data Types: Integers, Floating-point numbers, booleans, strings.

### Integers
whole numbers, negative or positive

```
a = 1
type(a)
a
```
<div class="output">>>> a = 1
>>> type(a)
<class 'int'>
>>> a
1

</div>


### Floats
similar to decimal field

```
b = 1.2
type(b)
b
```

<div class="output">>>> b = 1.2
>>> type(b)
<class 'float'>
>>> b
1.2
</div>


### Booleans

"In computer science, the Boolean data type is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true 
and false) which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. It is named after George 
Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid 19th century." [-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)

```
c = True
d = False
type(c)
c
int(d)
# TODO float(d), long(d),
```

<div class="output">>>> c = True
>>> d = False
>>> type(c)
<class 'bool'>
>>> c
True
>>> int(d)
0
</div>

### Strings
```
my_string = "Hello world!"
type(my_string)
my_string
print(my_string)
my_string + my_string
my_string[1] # this will make more sense when we learn lists later
```


<div class="output">
>>> my_string = "Hello world!"
>>> type(my_string)
<class 'str'>
>>> my_string
'Hello world!'
>>> print(my_string)
Hello world!
>>> my_string + my_string
'Hello world!Hello world!'
>>> my_string[1] # this will make more sense when we learn lists later
'e'
</div>

# <a name="arithmetic"></a> Arithmetic: Adding, subtracting, multiplication, assignment arithmetic (assignment operators).
<img src="figures/ed9e3c89.png" alt="if flow" width="600px"/>

```
# This is a comment
type(a)
type(b)

# Addition
a + b
type(a+b)

# Subtraction
b - a
type(b-a)

# Division
a/b
type(a/b)

# Exponents
4**b
#or
pow(4,b)
type(a**b)

# Remainder 
4 % 3

# Absolute value
abs(22-32)

# Round, Floor, Ceiling
round(3.2)
int(3.2)
import math
math.ceil(3.2)
math.floor(3.7)
int(3.7)

```

<div class="output">

## Assignment operators

```
a += 1
a

a -= 1

<h3><font color="red">Challenge Questions:</font></h3>
1. We have a value of 200 gene counts for a certain sample. One gene has a count of 7. 
    - What is the relative proportion of reads for this gene?
    - We find some novel information saying that all values have had `sqrt()` or `x**0.5` performed. Now what is the relative proportion?

```

my_tuple[-1]

## Tuples vs Lists
<img src="figures/b783230c.png" alt="if flow" width="600px"/>


```
my_list[0] = 135
my_list
my_tuple[0] = 135
my_tuple

```
<div class="output">
>>> my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> my_list[0] = 135
>>> my_list
[135, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
>>> my_tuple[0] = 135
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> my_tuple
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

</div>

There are quite a few differences between the two and some other features we talked about earlier for lists may work with tuples. 
I don't use tuples a ton but feel free to experiment and see what you can do with one but not the other. Check out the docs or see 
what features a class has using `list.__dict__.keys()` and `tuple.__dict__.keys()`. (These commands will make more sense later when 
we talk about attributes and dictionaries)

## Sets
Lets consider the events in my_set and my_set2 with respect to events A and B commonly used in denoting events in set theory. 
With respect to the pictures in the graph below where GREEN is the results objects in the set, consider the following events:

-  The relative complement is considered set difference in statistics. That is events in one group (B or `my_set2`) not in the other group (A or` my_set`).
    + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{B}-\text{A}   " />    OR   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{   my\_set2}-\text{my\_set   }" />

-  The relative complement is considered set difference in statistics. That is events in one group (A or `my_set`) not in the other group (B or `my_set2`).
    + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{A}-\text{B}   " />    OR   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{   my\_set}-\text{my\_set2   }" />

- In stats a union of two events is consider events in situation A and B. Similarly we consider `my_set` and `my_set2`.
    + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{A}\cup\text{B}   " />    OR   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{   my\_set}\cup\text{my\_set2}" />

- In stats a union of two events is consider events in situation A or B. Similarly we consider `my_set` or `my_set2`.
    + <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{A}\cup\text{B}   " />    OR   <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \text{   my\_set}\cup\text{my\_set2}" />

1. What is the union, intersection, and difference between the following two sets of amino acids in protein A and B?
   ```
   A = {'G', 'F', 'P', 'S', 'T', 'Y', 'C', 'M', 'M', 'Q'}
   B = { 'Y', 'C', 'Q', 'G', 'F', 'P', 'T', 'W', 'E', 'N'}
   ```

## Dictionaries
- A list of codes, terms, keys, etc., and their meanings, used by a computer program or system.
- Dictionary values are pointed too by the keys. Values can be anything from int, float, and bool to lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    + <img src="figures/abda21dc.png" alt="if flow" width="600px"/>


```

# <a name="range"></a> Range
The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

<img src="figures/d9454cac.png" alt="if flow" width="600px"/>

Much more info is available on this [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range).

```
type(range(0,10))

# first arg is start, 2nd is finish, 3rd is gap size (default is 1)
list(range(0,10))
list(range(0,10,5))
```

<div class="output">
<class 'range'>
>>> # first arg is start, 2nd is finish, 3rd is gap size (default is 1)
>>> list(range(0,10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> list(range(0,10,5))
[0, 5]
</div>



# <a name="stringformatting"></a> String Formatting

This is just a brief intro. There are lots of features to this topic but this seems to solve 95% of tasks/cases for me.
If you interested in more info regarding the other featrures checkout [Pyformat](https://pyformat.info/).

<img src="figures/1a9dfa16.png" alt="if flow" width="600px"/>

```
extra = "Goodbye."
print("It was nice to meet you. %s" %extra)
print("It was nice to meet you. %s %s" %(extra,extra))
print(f"It was nice to meet you. {extra}")
# or
print("It was nice to meet you. {}".format(extra))
```

<div class="output">
>>> extra = "Goodbye."
>>> print("It was nice to meet you. %s" %extra)
It was nice to meet you. Goodbye.
>>> print("It was nice to meet you. %s %s" %(extra,extra))
It was nice to meet you. Goodbye. Goodbye.
>>> print(f"It was nice to meet you. {extra}")
It was nice to meet you. Goodbye.
>>> print("It was nice to meet you. {}".format(extra))
It was nice to meet you. Goodbye.

# <a name="exercise" style="color:red"></a> Group Exercises (~30 mins)
1. Create a list of all even values from 0 to 100.
- What is the length of the list?
- What is the average of the list?  
- What is the sum of the 13 to the 17th elements in the list?
- What is the 16th element from the end?
- Replace the 23rd element with the value 200. Now what is the average?


2. Learning to use python it is good to have an experimental mentality to learn more about edge cases
- What is the empty list in terms of a boolean value?
- What is an empty dictionary in terms of a boolean value?
- What about a float value of 0?


3. Create a string in python with some information about yourself (Name, background, etc.) 
- Take the string you created and make a list out of it where each word is an element.
- Now recreate the string with two spaces where there was originally one space. There are two ways, one using the list 
and one using the original string. Can you think of both?
