## Installing Software

### Virtual Environments
[Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) give you the option to create a lightweight, self contained Python install where you can specify each module that is installed. This is a great option for keeping your system neat and tidy, and also keeps development versions of specific software isolated from your main Python library folders.

Another great thing about virtual environments is that you can use them to "snapshot" a set of modules for a project. As updates are released for these modules, the version you used for your project may become obsolete or unavailable. Keeping a virtual environment associated with the project ensures that you can always run the exact same versions of the software.

--- 
### Python2 virtual environment and software install
Lets try it out by installing an older software package that hasn't yet been updated to support Python3.

https://github.com/ibest/ARC


Log into the server and run the following commands.

##### Setup
```bash
cd /share/workshop/prereq_workshop/$USER/python

# Create the virtual environment:
virtualenv py2ARC.venv

# Activate virtual environment (note the change in your command prompt):
source /share/workshop/prereq_workshop/$USER/python/py2ARC.venv/bin/activate
```
<h3><font color="red">At this point your bash prompt should start with (py2ARC.venv). If it does, click "Yes", if you are stuck click "No" or post a question on Slack.</font></h3>




##### Install software using pip and a [setup.py build script for setuptools](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).

Installing biopython can take a little while. If you want you can learn what ARC does and review the installation instructions [here](http://ibest.github.io/ARC/#ARCInstallation).

```bash
# First we need to install dependencies:
# Biopython v1.76 was the last version released for Python 2.7.x
pip install biopython==1.76

# Clone a copy of the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ibest/ARC.git

# Install the software
cd ARC
python setup.py install


# Now you can test the install, but first we need to put a mapper and assembler in our path:
module load bowtie2
module load spades

cd test_data

ARC

```

<h3><font color="red">At this point you should see a lot of text scrolling up the screen. This is ARC performing an iterative assembly process on some test data. If you see this, click "Yes", if you are stuck click "No" or post a question on Slack.</font></h3>

You can interrupt the assembly at any time using ctrl+c.

Once you are finished working in the Virtual Environment, you can exit it with the deactivate command. This will set your path and environment variables back to their normal state.

```bash
deactivate
```


-----



### Python3 virtual environment and software install

Python3 [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) are basically the same, but require slightly different commands.

Make sure that your python2 environment has been deactivated and then run the following.

```bash
# We need a different version of python3 that supports virtual environments:
module load anaconda3
python3 -m venv py3venv

source py3venv/bin/activate

```
**Note that if you get an error while creating the py3venv environment, you may have to delete it and try again after making sure to load the anaconda3 module.**

<h3><font color="red">At this point your bash prompt should start with (py3venv). If it does, click "Yes", if you are stuck click "No" or post a question on Slack.</font></h3>


Now we are ready to install modules into our Python3 virtual environment. Lets try out the [covid](https://pypi.org/project/covid/) package to query data on the novel corona virus.

To do this we will use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), the package installer for Python. Pip will automatically download and install all of the dependencies needed for the covid package.

Again, this process might take a little while, so while you wait, visit the [covid](https://pypi.org/project/covid/) page, scroll down to the "How to use" section of the page and review the usage instructions. The covid package installs includes a command line tool written in Python (you can look at some of the source code using ```less ./py3venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/covid/cli.py```). Try to determine the number of confirmed cases based on worldometers and john_hopkins data sources. Are they the same?


```bash
# Installing is easy, just use pip!

pip install covid

# Once the install has finished, run python:
python
```


Try running the following code to fetch the latest data on Italy. What kind of data type does get_status_by_country_name() return? You should be able to access elements of the dataset using information from yesterday's course material.

```python
from covid import Covid

covid = Covid()


covid.get_status_by_country_name("italy")
```

Once you are finished, remember that you can exit Python using ctrl+D, and use deactivate to exit from the Python3 virtual environment.

## <a name="top">Basic File Operations</a>

Reading and writing files in Python is easy with built in support for common operations.

In order to work with a file, we send a request to the operating system to open a **handle** to the file. This **handle** allows us to send and/or receive information from the file depending on what **mode** we open the file in. 

The steps are:
1) Open a file handle.
2) Read or write data.
3) Close file handle.

#### Writing to a file:

```python
# 1) Open a file handle to write text to:
handle = open("test_file.txt", "w")

# 2) Lets practice looping over a range of integers and writing them to our file:
for i in range(0,20):
    handle.write(f"Integer {i}\n")

# 3) Close the file handle
handle.close()

# If you are running ipython try "cat test_file.txt" to check the contents of the file.
```

#### Reading from a file:

Now lets reverse the process and read the information back in from the file. This time we will try an alternative approach that automatically closes the file for us when we are done:

```python

# Option 1, iterates over the file line by line:
with open("test_file.txt", "r") as handle:
    for line in handle:
        print(line.strip())

# Option 2, reads the entire file in and prints it
with open("test_file.txt", "r") as handle:
    print(handle.read())

# Bonus: What if we want to look at the file manually?
handle = open("test_file.txt", "r")
line = next(handle)
print(line)
handle.close()

```

-------

#### What about compressed files?

```python
# First we need a compressed file to work with.
# Use urllib to download the file from GitHub

import urllib
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics-training/2020-Bioinformatics_Prerequisites_Workshop/master/Intro_to_Python/example_data.fastq.gz"

urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, 'example_data.fastq.gz')


# Use more functions in os to check on the download:
import os
os.path.isfile("example_data.fastq.gz")

os.path.getsize("example_data.fastq.gz")

# If you are running ipython, try "less -S example_data.fastq.gz" to get a look at the file.
```

The file we just download is a [FastQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) formatted file, containing data from an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. If you look closely, you will see that each record is made up of four lines. You will learn more about this file type later in the workshop.

1) The first line starts with "@" and contains the Read ID.
2) The second line contains the actual sequence data (ACGT or N).
3) The third line is a "+" sign, and in some older files also contains the Read ID.
4) The fourth line contains an [ASCII encoding of the Phred + 33 quality score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Quality).

```

If we try to open this file like we did with the previous file we will get incomprehensible garbage. In order to read the file properly, we need to uncompress it. The Python gzip module allows us to do this, but otherwise works like the normal file handle.

```python
import gzip

# Note that 'rt' opens the file for text reading
handle = gzip.open("example_data.fastq.gz", 'rt')

l = next(handle)

print(l)

handle.close()
```

Lets pretend that for some reason we want to process the whole file and count how many times we see each character? Can you figure out how this code works?

```python
# Create an empty dictionary
chrcount = {}

# read in each line of the fasta file, count character occurrences
with gzip.open('example_data.fasta.gz', 'rt') as h:
    for line in h:
        for ch in line.strip():
            if ch not in chrcount:
                chrcount[ch] = 0
            chrcount[ch] += 1

# Print out the character (dictionary key) and associated value (the count):
for k, v in chrcount.items():
    print(f"character:{k}, count:{v}")

```


We might want to print out values from most common to least. To do this, we need a way to sort. Python has a built in "sorted" function that can take care of this for us. The sorted() function is a little bit tricky because the "key" argument has to be a function. This is very powerful because it allows flexibility, but can also be confusing.

```python
# Check how sorted works:
sorted([4,2,5,6,2])

# 
sorted([4,2,5,6,2], reverse=True)

# Sorting your dictionary by value requires some tricks:
sorted(chrcount.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# How does this work?
def getv(x):
    return(x[1])

sorted(chrcount.items(), key=getv, reverse=True)

```


#### Exercises

1. Try to open the example_data.fastq.gz file without using gzip. Read the first line into a variable called "l", then print it. What happens?

1. How many base pairs long is the first read in the file?

1. The ord() function will return the ASCII value for a single character. Write some code to read the fourth line from the fastq file, then covert the values to a quality score and calculate the average quality value. 
    *  Hints: The last character is a line return (\n), use strip() to remove it. You can use list comprehension or a for loop to split up the characters and run ord() on each one.  

1. Write some code to figure out how many total lines are in example_data.fastq.gz. How many reads is this?

## <a name="top">BioPython</a>

<img src="figures/biopython_logo_m.png" alt="BioPython" width="25%" align="right"/>


[Biopython](https://biopython.org/) is an open source collection of tools for manipulating biological data. The types of data it supports and operations it provides for these data types are documented in the [Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook](https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) and are quite extensive. 


Explore Biopython Sequence objects

```python
from Bio.Seq import Seq

# Create a Seq object:
m = Seq("AGTCCGTAG")

# Normal string indexing still work
print(m[0])

# Slicing still works, get the first two letters:
m[:2]

# And the last two:
m[-2:]

# Print the Positive and Negative number index
for index, letter in enumerate(m):
    print(f"{index} {index - len(m)} {letter}")

# In some cases sequences may need to be upper/lower case:
m.lower()

m.upper()

# Characters can be counted just like with strings:
100 * (m.count('C') + m.count('G')) / len(m)

# We can even join two Seq() objects, or a Seq() and a String:
n = m + "AAAAAAAAAAA"

print(n)

# However Seq objects also support a number of useful functions:
m.reverse_complement()

m.translate(table=11)


```


[SeqIO](https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html#sec51) provides an interface to read/write a large number of different Bioinformatics file formats. 

Using SeqIO should look very familiar after learning about file handles. Note that we need to provide a file type so that SeqIO knows how to properly read our file.

```python 
# Import SeqIO module
from Bio import SeqIO

# Create  a gzip file handle 
handle = gzip.open("example_data.fastq.gz", 'rt')

# Tell SeqIO to parse the data in the file in fastq format
parser = SeqIO.parse(handle, 'fastq')

# Extract the first record
record = next(parser)

# Explore the record object:
record.id

record.seq

len(record)

# Calculate average quality score
sum(record.letter_annotations['phred_quality'])/len(record) 


```

Use SeqIO to get the lenths of all sequences in the file and calculate statistics.

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import gzip
import statistics

with gzip.open("example_data.fastq.gz", 'rt') as h:
    l = [len(r) for r in SeqIO.parse(h, 'fastq')]


max(l)

min(l)

sum(l)/len(l)

# How many reads are < 427bp?
sum(m < 429 for m in l)

sum(m > 429 for m in l)

```

Another common use of SeqIO is to convert from one file type to another:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
import gzip

with gzip.open("example_data.fastq.gz", 'rt') as inf, gzip.open("example_data.fasta.gz", 'wt') as outf:
    SeqIO.convert(inf, "fastq", outf, "fasta")

# If you are running ipython, use less to check whether the file has been converted.
```


---------

## <a name="top">CSV package</a>

It is commonly necessary to read or write tabular data when doing bioinformatics work. Python has a handy module to support this called [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

Lets experiment with writing and reading tabular files using the DictWriter and DictReader classes. 

Writing data out.
```python
import csv

# First lets write an example file
with open('my_data.csv', 'w') as csvfile:
    # Create a list with the column headers
    fieldnames = ['SampleID','Age','Treatment', 'Weight']
    # Create a DictWriter, use tabs to delimit columns 
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames, delimiter='\t')
    # Write out the header
    writer.writeheader()
    
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse1", "Age":4, "Treatment":"Control", "Weight":3.2})
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse2", "Age":5, "Treatment":"Control", "Weight":3.6 })
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse3", "Age":4, "Treatment":"Control", "Weight":3.8 })
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse4", "Age":4, "Treatment":"ad libitum", "Weight":3.6 })
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse5", "Age":4, "Treatment":"ad libitum", "Weight":3.7 })
    writer.writerow({"SampleID":"mouse6", "Age":4, "Treatment":"ad libitum", "Weight":3.5 })

# If you are running ipython, try checking the contents of the file with "cat my_data.csv"

```

Reading data in from a file
```python
import csv

with open('my_data.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    for row in reader:
        print(f"SampleID:{row['SampleID']}, Age:{row['Age']}, Treatment:{row['Treatment']}, Weight:{row['Weight']}")


```




#### Exercises

1. Use SeqIO to filter the records in from example_data.fastq.gz. Create a new file called data_filtered.fastq. Only write reads that DO NOT start with "AGGG". How many reads were there?

1. Use SeqIO and the CSV package to record statistics for the reads in example_data.fastq.gz. Create a CSV file called read_stats.tsv. Create a DictWriter with column names: (ReadID, Length, GCcontent, AverageQuality). Collect each of these pieces of information for each read, and write it to the CSV file.  

1. Use SeqIO and a Dictionary, count the frequency of the first 15bp and last 15bp of each read in example_data.fastq.gz. What are the most common sequences?

1. Using the covid module, download the latest data and export it to a CSV file. Save a copy somewhere and make some informative plots using R later in the week.

## Wrapping up

*  Learning a new programming language takes time and patience. This rapid overview may have felt overwhelming, especially if you haven't programmed before. That is pretty normal.
*  Keep practicing, hands-on programming is the only way to learn. A great option is to just "play" and see what happens.
    *  Employ the Scientific Method: 1) Form a hypothesis about how Python works, 2) Design an experiment to test your hypothesis, 3) Reject or accept your hypothesis depending on the results.
    *  There are a nearly overwhelming number of free tutorials online. Working through these tutorials is a great way to keep learning. 
*  Many of the ideas we discussed today are common to most programming languages, even if some details of syntax differ. During the intro to R section, look for similarities (and differences). If you understand the concepts, you can always Google for syntax.



*  If you get stuck solving a problem, try to break it down into a set of simple steps.
    *  Define (write down) your inputs.
    *  Define (write down) your outputs.
    *  Once you have inputs and outputs defined, you often will see a path to the solution.
    *  If not, look for a first simple step (e.g. How should I load the data?, How should I store the data?).
    *  Continue to identify steps that lead you towards the set of outputs you defined.
    *  Each of these steps will help you understand your data and the problem better, and eventually help you find the path to a solution.
