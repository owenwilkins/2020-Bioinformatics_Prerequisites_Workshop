        -  Beautiful code, PEP8, zen of python stuff
    -  Key concepts of interacting with Python
        +  Interactive vs Script, python vs ipython
    -  Exercise: Log into server, edit path, run ipython, print "Hello World!"

*  Part 2: Basics of Python and Basic Data Types
    -  [Basic data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html)
        +  Integers, Floating-point numbers, boolean, 
            - abs(), 
        +  Strings
            -  Single and double quotes, escape characters, etc
                -  triple-quote strings 
            -  print()
            -  inserting variables 
        +  Comments (#)

*  Part 2: Hands on exercises (1:30 - 2pm)
    -  TODO
*  Part 2: Continued more advanced data types
    -  Lists and Tuples
        -  Zero-based index, variables vs objects
    -  Dictionaries
    -  Maybe Counter() and OrderedDict() from collections (https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)
    -  Hands on Exercises 2
*  Part 3: Flow control
        -  if statements
        -  range
        -  break, continue, pass
        -  For Loops, while etc
        -  Iterators - what is an iterator, how does it work?
        -  Maybe list comprehension, lambda etc?
    -  Basic file read and write
    -  Simple functions
        -  What is "Scope" and how does it work?
        -  defining variables, passing variables, returning variables
    -  Documenting your code

*  Part 4: Special topics
    -  Biopython
        -  SeqIO, Maybe some of the NCBI support, converting files, 
            -  TODO: check the biopython tutorial/cookbook http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
    -  CSV package maybe https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
